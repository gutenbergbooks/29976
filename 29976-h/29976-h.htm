<h1><span class="sp1"><i>WEAK</i> <b><span class="scl">ON SQUARE ROOTS</span></b></span></h1>

<h2><i>By Russell Burton</i></h2>

<p class="hd1">Illustrated by TOM BEECHAM</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As his coach</span> sped through
dusk-darkened Jersey meadows,
Ronald Lovegear, fourteen years
with Allied Electronix, embraced
his burden with both arms, silently
cursing the engineer who was deliberately
rocking the train. In his
thin chest he nursed the conviction
that someday there would be an intelligent
robot at the throttle of the
5:10 to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>He carefully moved one hand
and took a notebook from his pocket.
That would be a good thing to
mention at the office next Monday.</p>

<p>Again he congratulated himself
for having induced his superiors to
let him take home the company's
most highly developed mechanism
to date. He had already forgiven
himself for the little white lie that
morning.</p>

<p>"Pascal," he had told them, "is
a little weak on square roots." That
had done it!</p>

<p>Old Hardwick would never permit
an Allied computer to hit the
market that was not the absolute
master of square roots. If Lovegear
wanted to work on Pascal on
his own time it was fine with the
boss.</p>

<p>Ronald Lovegear consulted his
watch. He wondered if his wife
would be on time. He had told
Corinne twice over the phone to
bring the station wagon to meet him.
But she had been so forgetful lately.
It was probably the new house; six
rooms to keep up without a maid
was quite a chore. His pale eyes
blinked. He had a few ideas along
that line too. He smiled and gave
the crate a gentle pat.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Corinne was</span> at the station,
and she had brought the station
wagon. Lovegear managed to get
the crate to the stairs of the coach
where he consented to the assistance
of a porter.</p>

<div class="figr">
<img src="images/001.png" width="356" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"It's not really heavy," he told
Corinne as he and the porter waddled
through the crowd. "Actually
only 57 pounds, four ounces. Aluminum
casing, you know ..."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't ..." began Corinne.</p>

<p>"But it's delicate," he continued.
"If I should drop this ..." He shuddered.</p>

<p>After the crate had been placed
lengthwise in the rear of the station
wagon, Corinne watched Ronald
tuck a blanket around it.</p>

<p>"It's not very cold, Ronald."</p>

<p>"I don't want it to get bounced
around," he said. "Now, please,
Corinne, do drive carefully." Not
until she had driven half a block
did he kiss her on the cheek. Then
he glanced anxiously over his shoulder
at the rear seat. Once he
thought Corinne hit a rut that could
have been avoided.</p>

<p>Long after Corinne had retired
that night she heard Ronald pounding
with a brass hammer down in
his den. At first she had insisted he
take the crate out to his workshop.
He looked at her with scientific
aloofness and asked if she had the
slightest conception of what "this
is worth?" She hadn't, and she went
to bed. It was only another one of
his gestures which was responsible
for these weird dreams. That night
she dreamed Ronald brought home
a giant octopus which insisted on
doing the dishes for her. In the
morning she woke up feeling unwanted.</p>

<p>Downstairs Ronald had already
put on the coffee. He was wearing
his robe and the pinched greyness
of his face told Corinne he had
been up half the night. He poured
coffee for her, smiling wanly. "If
I have any commitments today,
Corinne, will you please see that
they are taken care of?"</p>

<p>"But you were supposed to get
the wallpaper for the guest
room...."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, dear. But time
is so short. They might want Pascal
back any day. For the next week or
two I shall want to devote most of
my time ..."</p>

<p>"<i>Pascal?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes. The machine&mdash;the computer."
He smiled at her ignorance.
"We usually name the expensive
jobs. You see, a computer of this
nature is really the heart and soul
of the mechanical man we will construct."</p>

<p>Corinne didn't see, but in a few
minutes she strolled toward the den,
balancing her coffee in both hands.
With one elbow she eased the door
open. There it was: an innocent
polished cabinet reaching up to her
shoulders. Ronald had removed one
of the plates from its side and she
peeped into the section where the
heart and soul might be located.
She saw only an unanatomical
array of vacuum tubes and electrical
relays.</p>

<p>She felt Ronald at her back. "It
looks like the inside of a juke box,"
she said.</p>

<p>He beamed. "The same relay
systems used in the simple juke box
are incorporated in a computer."
He placed one hand lovingly on
the top of the cabinet.</p>

<p>"But, Ronald&mdash;it doesn't even resemble
a&mdash;a mechanical man?"</p>

<p>"That's because it doesn't have
any appendages as yet. You know,
arms and legs. That's a relatively
simple adjustment." He winked at
Corinne with a great air of complicity.
"And I have some excellent
ideas along that line. Now, run
along, because I'll be busy most of
the day."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Corinne ran</span> along. She
spent most of the day shopping
for week-end necessities. On an irrational
last-minute impulse&mdash;perhaps
an unconscious surrender to
the machine age&mdash;she dug in the
grocery deep freeze and brought
out a couple of purple steaks.</p>

<p>That evening she had to call
Ronald three times for dinner, and
when he came out of the den she
noticed that he closed the door the
way one does upon a small child.
He chattered about inconsequential
matters all through dinner. Corinne
knew that his work was going
smoothly. A few minutes later she
was to know how smoothly.</p>

<p>It started when she began to put
on her apron to do the dishes. "Let
that go for now, dear," Ronald said,
taking the apron from her. He
went into the den, returning with
a small black box covered with
push buttons. "Now observe carefully,"
he said, his voice pitched
high.</p>

<p>He pushed one of the buttons,
waited a second with his ear cocked
toward the den, then pushed
another.</p>

<p>Corinne heard the turning of
metal against metal, and she slowly
turned her head.</p>

<p>"Oh!" She suppressed a shriek,
clutching Ronald's arm so tightly
he almost dropped the control box.</p>

<p>Pascal was walking under his own
effort, considerably taller now with
the round, aluminum legs Ronald
had given him. Two metal arms
also hung at the sides of the cabinet.
One of these rose stiffly, as
though for balance. Corinne's
mouth opened as she watched the
creature jerk awkwardly across the
living room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronald! The fishbowl!"</p>

<p>Ronald stabbed knowingly at
several buttons.</p>

<p>Pascal pivoted toward them, but
not before his right arm swung
out and, almost contemptuously,
brushed the fishbowl to the floor.</p>

<p>Corinne closed her eyes at the
crash. Then she scooped up several
little golden bodies and rushed for
the kitchen. When she returned
Ronald was picking up pieces of
glass and dabbing at the pool of
water with one of her bathroom
towels. Pascal, magnificently aloof,
was standing in the center of the
mess.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." Ronald looked up.
"It was my fault. I got confused
on the buttons."</p>

<p>But Corinne's glances toward the
rigid Pascal held no indictment. She
was only mystified. There was something
wrong here.</p>

<p>"But Ronald, he's so ugly without
a head. I thought that all
robots&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he explained, "we
would put heads on them for display
purposes only. Admittedly that
captures the imagination of the
public. That little adapter shaft at
the top could be the neck, of
course...."</p>

<p>He waved Corinne aside and continued
his experiments with the
home-made robot. Pascal moved in
controlled spasms around the living
room. Once, he walked just a little
too close to the floor-length window&mdash;and
Corinne stood up nervously.
But Ronald apparently had
mastered the little black box.</p>

<p>With complete confidence Corinne
went into the kitchen to do
the dishes. Not until she was elbow
deep in suds did she recall her
dreams about the octopus. She
looked over her shoulder, and the
curious, unwanted feeling came
again.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The following</span> afternoon&mdash;after
Ronald had cancelled
their Sunday drive into the country&mdash;Pascal,
with constant exhortations
by Ronald at the black box,
succeeded in vacuum cleaning the
entire living room. Ronald was ecstatic.</p>

<p>"Now do you understand?" he
asked Corinne. "A mechanical servant!
Think of it! Of course mass
production may be years away,
but ..."</p>

<p>"Everyone will have Thursday
nights off," said Corinne&mdash;but Ronald
was already jabbing at buttons
as Pascal dragged the vacuum
cleaner back to its niche in the
closet.</p>

<p>Later, Corinne persuaded Ronald
to take her to a movie, but not
until the last moment was she certain
that Pascal wasn't going to
drag along.</p>

<p>Every afternoon of the following
week Ronald Lovegear called from
the laboratory in New York to ask
how Pascal was getting along.</p>

<p>"Just fine," Corinne told him on
Thursday afternoon. "But he certainly
ruined some of the tomato
plants in the garden. He just doesn't
seem to hoe in a straight line. Are
you certain it's the green button I
push?"</p>

<p>"It's probably one of the pressure
regulators," interrupted Ronald.
"I'll check it when I get home."
Corinne suspected by his lowered
voice that Mr. Hardwick had
walked into the lab.</p>

<p>That night Pascal successfully
washed and dried the dishes, cracking
only one cup in the process.
Corinne spent the rest of the evening
sitting in the far corner of the
living room, thumbing the pages of
a magazine.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon&mdash;prompted
perhaps by that perverse
female trait which demands completion
of all projects once started&mdash;Corinne
lingered for several minutes
in the vegetable department at
the grocery. She finally picked out
a fresh, round and blushing pumpkin.</p>

<p>Later in her kitchen, humming a
little tune under her breath, Corinne
deftly maneuvered a paring
knife to transform the pumpkin into
a very reasonable facsimile of a
man's head. She placed the pumpkin
over the tiny shaft between Pascal's
box-shaped shoulders and
stepped back.</p>

<p>She smiled at the moon-faced
idiot grinning back at her. He was
complete, and not bad-looking! But
just before she touched the red button
once and the blue button twice&mdash;which
sent Pascal stumbling out
to the backyard to finish weeding
the circle of pansies before dinner&mdash;she
wondered about the gash that
was his mouth. She distinctly remembered
carving it so that the
ends curved upward into a frozen
and quite harmless smile. But one
end of the toothless grin seemed to
sag a little, like the cynical smile of
one who knows his powers have
been underestimated.</p>

<p>Corinne would not have had to
worry about her husband's reaction
to the new vegetable-topped Pascal.
Ronald accepted the transformation
good-naturedly, thinking that
a little levity, once in a while, was
a good thing.</p>

<p>"And after all," said Corinne
later that evening, "I'm the one
who has to spend all day in the
house with ..." She lowered her
voice: "With Pascal."</p>

<p>But Ronald wasn't listening. He
retired to his den to finish the plans
for the mass production of competent
mechanical men. One for
every home in America.... He fell
asleep with the thought.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Corinne and Pascal</span> spent
the next two weeks going
through pretty much the same routine.
He, methodically jolting
through the household chores; she,
walking aimlessly from room to
room, smoking too many cigarettes.
She began to think of Pascal as a
boarder. Strange&mdash;at first he had
been responsible for that unwanted
feeling. But now his helpfulness
around the house had lightened
her burden. And he was so cheerful
all the time! After living with
Ronald's preoccupied frown for
seven years ...</p>

<p>After luncheon one day, when
Pascal neglected to shut off the garden
hose, she caught herself scolding
him as if he were human. Was
that a shadow from the curtain
waving in the breeze, or did she
see a hurt look flit across the mouth
of the pumpkin? Corinne put out
her hand and patted Pascal's cylindrical
wrist.</p>

<p>It was warm&mdash;<i>flesh</i> warm.</p>

<p>She hurried upstairs and stood
breathing heavily with her back to
the door. A little later she thought
she heard someone&mdash;someone with
a heavy step&mdash;moving around
downstairs.</p>

<p>"I left the control box down
there," she thought. "Of course, it's
absurd...."</p>

<p>At four o'clock she went slowly
down the stairs to start Ronald's
dinner. Pascal was standing by the
refrigerator, exactly where she had
left him. Not until she had started
to peel the potatoes did she notice
the little bouquet of pansies in the
center of the table.</p>

<p>Corinne felt she needed a strong
cup of tea. She put the water on
and placed a cup on the kitchen
table. Not until she was going to
sit down did she decide that perhaps
Pascal should be in the other
room.</p>

<p>She pressed the red button, the
one which should turn him around,
and the blue button, which should
make him walk into the living
room. She heard the little buzz of
mechanical life as Pascal began to
move. But he did not go into the
other room! He was holding a chair
for her, and she sat down rather
heavily. A sudden rush of pleasure
reddened her cheeks. <i>Not since sorority
days ...</i></p>

<p>Before Pascal's arms moved away
she touched his wrist again, softly,
only this time her hand lingered.
And his wrist <i>was</i> warm!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"When do they</span> want
Pascal back at the lab?"
she asked Ronald at dinner that
evening, trying to keep her voice
casual.</p>

<p>Ronald smiled. "I think I might
have him indefinitely, dear. I've
got Hardwick convinced I'm working
on something revolutionary."
He stopped. "Oh, Corinne! You've
spilled coffee all over yourself."</p>

<p>The following night Ronald was
late in getting home from work. It
was raining outside the Newark
station and the cabs deliberately
evaded him. He finally caught a
bus, which deposited him one block
from his house. He cut through the
back alley, hurrying through the
rain. Just before he started up the
stairs he glanced through the
lighted kitchen window. He
stopped, gripping the railing for
support.</p>

<p>In the living room were Pascal
and Corinne. Pascal was reclining
leisurely in the fireside chair; Corinne
was standing in front of him.
It was the expression on her face
which stopped Ronald Lovegear.
The look was a compound of restraint
and compulsion, the reflection
of some deep struggle in Corinne's
soul. Then she suddenly
leaned forward and pressed her lips
to Pascal's full, fleshy pumpkin
mouth. Slowly, one of Pascal's aluminum
arms moved up and encircled
her waist.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovegear stepped back into
the rain. He stood there for several
minutes. The rain curled around
the brim of his hat, dropped to
his face, and rolled down his cheeks
with the slow agitation of tears.</p>

<p>When, finally, he walked around
to the front and stamped heavily
up the stairs, Corinne greeted him
with a flush in her cheeks. Ronald
told her that he didn't feel "quite
up to dinner. Just coffee, please."
When it was ready he sipped slowly,
watching Corinne's figure as she
moved around the room. She
avoided looking at the aluminum
figure in the chair.</p>

<p>Ronald put his coffee down,
walked over to Pascal, and, gripping
him behind the shoulders,
dragged him into the den.</p>

<p>Corinne stood looking at the
closed door and listened to the furious
pounding.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Ten minutes later</span> Ronald
came out and went straight to
the phone.</p>

<p>"Yes! Immediately!" he told the
man at the freight office. While he
sat there waiting Corinne walked
upstairs.</p>

<p>Ronald did not offer to help the
freight men drag the box outside.
When they had gone he went into
the den and came back with the
pumpkin. He opened the back door
and hurled it out into the rain. It
cleared the back fence and rolled
down the alley stopping in a small
puddle in the cinders.</p>

<p>After a while the water level
reached the mouth and there was a
soft choking sound. The boy who
found it the next morning looked at
the mouth and wondered why anyone
would carve such a sad Jack-O'-Lantern.</p>

<p class="hd2">THE END</p>
